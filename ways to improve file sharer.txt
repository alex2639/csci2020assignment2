Ways to improve file sharer:

If there were to be directories in the shared folder, you could check to see if the file is a directory
(using "folder.isDirectory()"). If so, you could navigate through all of the files in that directory.

The file sharer could use a DirectoryChooser to allow the user to select the file they want to use
instead of hard-coding it.

The file sharer could be more user-friendly by making the appearance look more organized. For example,
the download button could be aligned with the table that has the files in the server. There could also be
labels to label which files are on the shared folder and which files are on the server.
